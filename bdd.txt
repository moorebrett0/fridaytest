Overview

I want to write a program to count how many times a specific word repeats within a given string.
==============================================================================

1. I would like "a" to be able to find itself.

input: "a"
output: "1"

2. I would like "at" to be able to find itself and count 1.

input: "at"
output: "1"

3. At this time I would like to input 2 words but only count 1 word.

input: " at the"
output: "1"

4. The next step would be to input 2 of the same words and an additional word that it will not count

input: "at the at"
output: "2"

5. I would then add an input of 2 identical words with a string of 2 different words but be able to count the 2 words i have specified.
input: "at the fence at"
output: "2"

6. Lastly I want to be able to check how many times a word shows up in a string.
input word to check : "at"
input words to check with : "i was at a party and left at one o'clock"
Output: "2"
